Input will be taken from a file named "input.txt". The file contents are as follows.
3  // The first line indicates the number of resources (m)
5 // The second line indicates the number of processes (n)
10 5 7 //The third line indicates the total number of instances of each resource  (1*m). Here, there are 10, 5, and 7 instances of R1, R2, and R3 respectively
7 5 3 //The next n lines indicate the maximum requirements of each process (max matrix: n*m)
3 2 2
9 0 2
2 2 2
4 3 3
0 1 0 //The next n lines indicate the allocated resources for each process (allocation matrix: n*m)
2 0 0
3 0 2
2 1 1
0 0 2


For the given test case, the output should be:


16               //The number of safe sequences 
1 3 0 2 4    // Safe sequences are printed in lexicographical (dictionary) order
1 3 0 4 2
1 3 2 0 4
1 3 2 4 0
1 3 4 0 2
1 3 4 2 0
1 4 3 0 2
1 4 3 2 0
3 1 0 2 4
3 1 0 4 2
3 1 2 0 4
3 1 2 4 0
3 1 4 0 2
3 1 4 2 0 
3 4 1 0 2
3 4 1 2 0
