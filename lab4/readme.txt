Operating Systems Lab 4 

Name: Shagufta Anjum
Rollno: 19XJ1A0568

INPUT:

The first line of the input represents the scheduling algorithm
a. 1 for FCFS
b. 2 for shortest-job first
c. 3 for shortest remaining time first
d. 4 for priority scheduling
e. 5 for round-robin scheduling

2. The second line of the input represents the number of processes
3. The third line of the input contains the arrival time of the processes
4. The fourth line represents the CPU burst times of the processes
5. In the case of priority scheduling, the fifth line represents the priority of each process.
Lesser the priority value, the higher the priority of the process
6. In the case of round-robin scheduling, the fifth line contains the time quantum.

OUTPUT:
1. The first line of the output is the waiting times of the processes separated by
space.
2. The second line of the output is the response times of the processes separated
by space.
3. The third line of the output is the turnaround times of the processes separated
by space.
4. The fourth line of the output is the throughput (number of processes executed per second)
